``Modern poetry claims to be a vision, that is to say, a knowledge of hidden, invisible realities. It is true that the poets of all times \& all places have said as much. But Homer, Virgil, or Dante insist that their poetry has to do with a revelation that comes from outside themselves: a god or demon speaks through their mouths... The modern poet declares that he is speaking in his own name: he extracts his visions from within himself. The disturbing disappearance of divine powers has coincided with the appearance of drugs as bestowers of the gift of poetic vision. The familiar demon, the muse, or the divine spirit have seen supplanted by laudanum, opium, hashish, \& more recently, Mexican drugs: peyote (mescaline) \& hallucinogenic mushrooms.'' \\

``If at some future period of the world's history men should acquire the art of flying, there an be no doubt that migration would become the custom, and whole nations would change their localities.  Man has, indeed, been always a migratory animal... What men do only at intervals birds do frequently, having greater freedom of movement.''
