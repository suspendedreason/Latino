Or out to Joyce's Island, longside \\
Crazy Corey-- \\
Hoghunted; broken sticks on rotted bridge, \& \\
The Greatest Novelist of Taco Bell; \\ 
In gravelyard we met a child named Osiris; \\
Flick of matchstick, \\
``Never robbed a place you faker''-- \\
Made a joke bout Meister Jimmy \\
(Too much devil's breath, a mummy's swaddled visit) \\
``Rinse yr mouth with soap for speaking Angled Saxon.'' \\
Clock a kayoat killed on curbside-- \\
Joyride-- \\
Leaving hair \& bone.
