Back to Baghdad by the Bay \\
The Four-One-Five at Sunset, \\
Golden Beatlamp, \\
Basecamp, beachhead \\
For the endgames \\
Of transcendence: \\
In an Age of Green Rush \\
Sight me syrinx-singing, \\
Several notes at once, \\
Below a fishbowl sky-- \\
White wake of nanocarbon \\
Dragons cross the T of old oak \\
Branches, cracked \& \\
Swirling, bark a \\
Topographic falcon's view of landscape: \\
Burnt plateau and rusting desert. \\
Near the creek of windmills-- \\
Windy City cast, and Westward sent-- \\
Now unattached to tank, or store, so \\
Energy, tho transferred, scatters untransformed.

--Scatter dandylion seed: \\
--Meadow's minor magic deed.

--Whitehaired, Old Man Pappus: \\
--Tells the time, and grants your wishes.

And parks in place of pioneer plight, \\
And poppy planters, law-protected-- \\
Here the pets outnumber people.
