Daytrip down Carmel, where Joan had taken \\
Gramophone, with red wine at a restaurant.

Stories telling over seafood: \textit{Mother}-- \\
Host had been to Munich-- \\
Left her rented flat to wander off \& at \\
The corner, checking sign which clearly stated \\
`Einbahnstrasse'-- \\
And so seeing, stated, \\
If I'm lost, I'll find my way back--
So she walks \\
a few more blocks, \\
\& sees? \\
Another Einbahnstrasse.

Joyous speaking Anglish, \\
Glorious Gaulish-Latin language \\
Super-tong, a \\
Pagan-Christian merger,  \\
Barbed Romano \\
Paxt tween campo, citta; \\
Commerce, science.
