He was a plastic surgeon. \\
He had a key to a better life. \\
He had a key to all mythologies. \\
You were to acquire scars with pride of experience. \\
He had learned this in Crescent City, from an eyepatched Creole, \\ And abroad, in Deutschland-- \\
Where men wore saberscars like medals.

"The acquisition of a horrible scar [on these boys'] cheek had the same psychological effect as the eradication of the scars from the cheek of my [patients]... The magic was in the meaning..."\footnote{Or as Xobal would say, in his paraphrase of Fisherking: "Just because the mechanisms are biochemical, doesn't mean the root causes aren't social-psychologic." \& Doesn't this mean we still (\& always, already) live in a witchcraft world, with so many forms forgotten? So the New Romantics say.}

The Magic was in the Meaning, he said. \\
The knife was always the same; it cut the flesh; \\
The Secret was self-conception. \\
His method consisted of the Medical Art \\
Of Creative Mental Imaging. \\
He believed in new habits: of thought, \& action. \\
We all had an in-built impulse for success; \\
It had been put there by our Lord Creator. \\
The problem was a blockage in our circuits.

You--yes, you: \\
When'd we Cease to Understand the World? \\
Coleridge got bang from Banks's botanic net \\
Under barktoothed, twisted, silverbroken \\
Oak, so small, in star \& wind \& systm \\
Ev'ry point a center.

And How each Man should build his Home, \\
Childe I know not. 

--Oh Mr Know Nothing, at it again! \\
Brktoothed, silverbroken \\
Ev'ry point a center. Distant \\
Cayot--Set my coat on mounded \\
Earth \& cave-in citadel of insex, \\
Watch its hazy shape horizoned \\
In the dustkey grass of this \\
American savannah.

The Afternoon Sun inquires tactful: \\
Ought one be a vine or trellis? \\
And which parts should liquify? \\
Which clutching roots to yank \\
Or branch; and which deserve to die? \\
To harden, blacken, lose sensation.

Where ought my swerving reach, \\
In chasing \& predicting light? \\
How like my shape to history, like \\
Pollock's painting-dancing record-- \\
Smoking arc and splatter where piss put out the fire\footnote{Peggy Guggenheim's, if mem'ry serves.} \\

Ledger, log decision, indecision, stimulation-- \\
Flood and droughts, the path of \\
Sun, provisions in the soil; \\
Where an owl nested in Hawaiian eucalyptus. \\
(Deed I missed it, \\
Pensive with the roadcut's crickets.)
