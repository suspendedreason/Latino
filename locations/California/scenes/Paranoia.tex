It was a paranoid time. Everyone so easy-spooked. Scared what people would say, scared of getting sued, getting deported, cancelled, censored. Scared some unforeseen and terrible thing might happen--punishment from God or Government, whispered Gossip. Closed-circuit cameras installed, in every homestead. We went out in masks and hoarded basics. No one would touch receipts or look at homeless people or even strangers, in case someone wanted to talk to them, breathe on them, kidnap their children. Kids needed to be constantly watched in case they were kidnapped, which could happen at any time or place. You had to be very vigilant. No one had had their child 'napped yet, but that was because of their great vigilance. Also, Ms. Acosta had a cousin, Rachel, whose roommate's child had been napped, and every once in a while on the national news you'd hear about it, or they'd put photos on milk cartons, so kidnapped kids could be recognized by grocery clerks.
