The Wind, \\
Like light \& fire, \\
Is wild \& free, \\
Connecting distant things-- \\
\& I am that Wind, \\
Here, on the cliffs of Montsegny. \\
Carrying signs \& buoying wings. \\
Here I pass a silent pilgrim \\
In past life he was sybarite; \\
Now flagellant he seeks out lashes. \\
Here I pass a stony cliff: \\
A seawave, so so slowly crashing \\
Only God can see it.

What sweet song will I bear to thee? \\
Or blessings, billow Buddha flags \\
Or shepherds' whistles  \\
Cross the waiting canyon. 

Do I dare to speak in place  \\
Of icon, ``You must change your life''? \\
The athlete's perfect form \& wife \\
Speak for me, better bitter message. \\
Or do I dare invoke the Cross-- \\
Or share cross-legged lotus lessons? \\
Words are only ever pointing; \\
Youth like me know nearly nothing.
