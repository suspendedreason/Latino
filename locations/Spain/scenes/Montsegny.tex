But the Wind, \\
Like light \& fire \\
Is wild \& free, \\
Connecting distant things-- \\
\& Iam that Wind, \\
Here, on the metamorph, Montseny. \\
Carrying signs \& buoying wings. \\
Here I pass an archivist, who prepped librettos for the best. \\ % Weak
Here is one who digs in weeds for herbal, ointment, spice \& seed. \\
Here a politician, like a hound-dog pulled to power; \\
Here a merry-faced mortician, manning body's latest hour.

Here I pass a pilgrim who in past life was a sybarite; \\
Now flagellant, he bears the lashes \\
Of the braided leather which I lilt \& lift like flag, to bare his back, thereby to better know him.

Now I pass a stony cliff: A wave so slowly crashing only God \& I can see it. 

What swe√©t song will I bear to thee? \\
Or blessings billow, Buddha's sacred flags, \\
Or shepherds' dying whistles far across the weighting canyon. \\
For the beauty of this place erases thought of waiting for damnation.

Do I dare to speak, disturb a peach, or preach an icon's quiet? \\
Do I dare say ``Change your life'' to clients?

Will I keep an analytic blankness? \\
Let the torso's form \& wife speak for my better bitter message.

Or do I dare invoke the Cross, or share cross-legged lotus lessons? \\
Words are only ever pointing; moonlit shine the flames reflecting. \\
Youth like me know nearly nothing.
