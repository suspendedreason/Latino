Broad Balboa, top a peak in \\
Panama, saw sea to shining sea, \& Me? \\
Grace to God for Southern Seas, for \\
Horizons which approached, recede, so \\
Occident could still suffice \\
For those who Orientalize \\
As Barbars saw the Visigoths \\
And Moorish slavers praised blue eyes.

``Best thing to do is dig one thing or place or man,'' \\
Til you know more than any man about it \\
So said Olson, on committing, not so much \\
To form as to environs-- \\
He should know! Ningland poet \\
Jim chose Dublin-- \\
Who am I above it?

\& the Beatific doubling "dig" \\
I dig everything, a problem \\
Better-known by Beats-- \\
Too much sun and too much stimulation-- \\
What's the answer, then, but study, \\
Smarter, harder.

Pound \& Olson, Prynne-- \\
All had things for stones, now din't they, \\
Sculpture, rockeology, and chiseled gemstonepoems \\
Or stacking layers, timely sediment, \& \\
Wood turned mineral by pressure, \\
Polished sequence shining. \\
Not like jamband Kerouac, who tossed it out \\
Thus liberated. \\
Permanent poetics and its birdsong-- \\
What is beautiful, ephemeral, \\
What lasts, a leaden echo?

``This is the morning, after the dispersion, \& the work of the morning is methodology: how to use oneself \& on what. That is my profession. I am an archaeologist of morning.''

So said Olson, cern'ing thru accumulation, \\
Centuries of text. \\
He loved the taste of soil, so he liked to say \\
He hunted clay for its inscriptions \\
Kept hallucinogens in an owl idol \\
``Composition by fieldwork'' \\
Studied alien maiz, \& rosette potsherds.

\& We are in the morning of man, \\
\& It is a time for questions of method.

Instead then of commitment, or an exploitation \\
On we go exploring. \\
From Carnival to Lent and Easter, \\
Feast of Feasts in Feastly cycle \\
Cross the Latin world, \\
Package, armchair travelers \\
Cook, von Humboldt, Banks, \textit{Jane Eyre} \\
Goethe's \textit{Journey}, Byron's \textit{Childe}, \\
Stevenson and Melville, Darwin, Wordsworth's Alps, or \\
Carvajal, who had the one last look at Amazonia, \\
But was caught up in worry for some future prison that he's \\
Tonguetied, cannot see or write straight, barely mentions \\
Hundred-mile towns or \\
Kayak orchestras or \\
Endless fruiting orchards found.

And too reporting (after Johnson) with  \\
An eye to study men \& manners \\
Protocols for hu√©spedes, and hospice philoxenia \\
As well as science, landscape, custom, way of life-- \\
In short, becoming those gold men of letters, who \\
To Andalusian soil gathered knowledge in their travels \\
Cross the cultures.

From Death to Resurrection: \\
Ye, I had known the seasons as a natural cycle \\
Never, til now, in Catholic Europe \\
Did I see them instead through rite \& symbol

(And who else would report that chatty ``ciao'', informal, had lost its whiff of offense, being said by tonedeaf tourists til the language changed with them.)

(And who else would report that CaliValley apps were sync'ing up the world to its protocols, its sharing system.)
