``En 189 acuñaba Henri Beraldi el término pirineísmo. Bajo él se agrupaba a aquellos que tenían la resistencia de ascender por las montañas, la facultad de percibir, y la habilidad para transmitirlo a los demás.'' (Wall text, Veruela Monastery, Zaragoza.)

Broad Balboa, top a peak in \\
Panama, saw sea to shining sea, \& Me? \\
Grace to God for Southern Seas, \\
Horizons which approached, recede, so \\
Occident could still suffice \\
For those who Orientalize \\
As Barbars saw the Visigoths \\
And Moorish slavers praised blue eyes.

``Best thing to do is dig-- \\
One thing or place or man,'' \\
Til knowing more than any man about it \\
So said Olson, on committing, not so much \\
To form as to environ-- \\
He should know! Ningland poet; \\
Jim chose foggy Dublin-- \\
Who am I above it, Johnson?

\& Beatific doubling, "dig"-- \\
But I? In better moods dig everything, a problem-- \\
Better-known to Beats-- \\
Of too much sun \& too much stim-- \\
What's the answer, then, but study? \\
Smarter, harder-- \\
(Porque no los dos?) \\
And better sure but slower, patient, \\
Play Pareto frontier; \\
Find the tax-free, double-dutied wins.

Well Pound \& Olson, Prynne-- \\
All had things for stones, now din't they, \\
Sculpture, rockeology, and chiseled gemstonepoems \\
Or stacking layers, timely sediment, \& \\
Wood turned mineral by pressure, \\
Polished sequence shining. \\
Not like jamband Kerouac, who tossed it out \\
Thus liberated. \\
Permanent poetics and its birdsong-- \\
What is beautiful, ephemeral, \\
What lasts, a leaden echo?

``This is the morning, after the dispersion, \\
\& the work of the morning is methodology: \\
how to use oneself \& on what. \\
That is my profession. \\
I am an archaeologist of morning.''

More said Olson, cern'ing thru accumulation, \\
Centuries of text-- \\
He loved the taste of soil, so said \\
And who are we to suspect? \\
Hunted hardened clay for scratching; \\
Stored his psychedelics in an owl idol \\
``Fieldwork composing'' \\
Chewed on alien maiz, \& gathered rosette potsherds.

And we are in the morning of man, \\
And that is a time for questions of method. \\
Dawning, always dawning, always setting; \\
Just a vantage; pick positions wisely. \\
Rather than commit, exploiting \\
Onward go with our exploring: \\
Carnival to Lent to Easter, \\
Feast of Feasts in Feastly cycle \\
Cross the Latin world, armchair travelers \\
Wordsworth's Alps \& Meister Darwin; \\
Banks' Tahiti; Byron's \textit{Childe}, \\
Goethe's \textit{Journey}; Cook, von Humboldt;
Stevenson and Melville, Brönte; \\
Carvajal, who blessed with final glance \\
At Amazon as civic wonder, squandered handsome, \\ 
Caught up anxious in some future prison, \\
Couldn't soar with kayak orchestras, \\
Or justify his sight with reason.

Within weeks the horses died, \\
Keratin hooves rotted in mire. \\
There is no time, these days, they say, \\
To drink the blood of Christ \\
(There is no other time) \\
Nor take the waters \\
Cannot even taste our sweat. \\
(The Kid is showing promise) \\
Playing Perhacs, pleas to coffee date: \\
Five minutes can you spare me, girl \\
You'll get Eternity.

And too reporting (after Johnson) with  \\
An eye to study men \& manners \\
Protocols for huéspedes, and hospice philoxenia \\
As well as science, landscape, custom, way of life-- \\
In short, becoming those gold men of letters, who \\
To Andalusian soil gathered knowledge in their travels \\
Cross the cultures.

From Death to Resurrection: \\
Ye, I had known the seasons as a natural cycle \\
Never, til now, in Catholic Europe \\
Did I see them instead through rite \& symbol, \& swearing \\
In a clearing, under God's first temple \\
That I'd bridge the basalt and the birdsong, \\
\& other oaths, which do not scan, \\
Of permanent poetics: what can last \& what is beautiful \\
And what is ever slipping lost, \\
Into an unrecovered past.

For who else would report that chatty ``ciao'', informal, lost its whiff of offense, being constantly invoked by tonedeaf tourists til the mothertongue adapted, chastened.

For who else would report that CaliValley apps were sync'ing up the world, teaching protocols and virtues; graphics, language, system?

``If there are no walls, there are no names''-- \\
We're hung up on Charles, contra native Paz, \\
Who saw in linèd borders only separation,
Said, The mill? It squeeze juice from life;
His cuartos, calles; ruas, rooms \\
Divided man from man, \& man from self, a violence \\
Mourning ``nuestra unidad''-—an unidad perdida.

Oh homogenocene-- \\
Whitman's world, spanned-- \\
Except as farce \& then as nightmare.

To navigate a gridded street, \\
And choose between two turns \\
Like cereal boxes. \\
Do the streets constrain us, \\
Or do the streets enable passage-- \\
One need only hack, like Carvajal, \\
Through undergrowth to know the difference, \\
And the mercantile notion of choice? \\
Is a neoliberal ethic, founded on consent, \\
So all agreed-to's fine \\
\& that which isn't, isn't \\
(How simplifying, simpl!) \\
Power, then, is bracketed, \\
Becomes the principle problem; \\
Questions like: Who built the grid, \\
\& when \& why; \\
Who set the table with options.
