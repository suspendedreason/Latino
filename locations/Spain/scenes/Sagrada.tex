Pale sapsucker. Yellow \\
Bellies, galling girdlers. \\
They used American immunology \\
In their hybrid grafts \\
So to save tradition.

This city of bas reliefs, \\
Mandalas in the cément suelo, \\
Lucid moments where you swear you see it all, \\
Then woozy slip below the waves.

At the main attraction, \\
No one looks \\
At the main attraction. \\
Just takes pictures, vemödalen. \\
Spare sight's labor, mem'ry's burden. \\

No one looks at the pictures either-- \\
Just shows them off to fam'ly, friends-- \\
And it makes you wonder what we're here on Earth for.

The stones not fully formed, the flowers \\
Still emerging from their undistinguished mass \\
A time of carving stones \\
And ``is'' a process of becoming.

And the pillars of the worldtemple \\
Are still held up by turtles; over portals, \\
Letters shaped from porticurling vine \\
Spelled OPUS, DEUS, 'pending from the side you saw it \\
And inside, the wheat sprouts from the  \\
Baldachin of crucifixion, while around \\
An arbolith, and ceiling?  \\
Star\&sunseedvorticeseventhorizon \\
Generating powder ratiate as light collapsing into \\
Pinhole darkness.

And outside, cobweb catchfalls draped from \\
Still-in-progress towers, \\
Of this stony ledger carved in scripture
