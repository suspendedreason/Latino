He on a piedra, she a pied-รก-terre \\
In prairie still I heard a starling \\
Rattle, prattle to its darling, \\
Di \& notte, so a \\
Sowing song that summoned mower, \\
Mourning dove at dawn on rooftop, \\
Roam \& roving, raving mad at reaper's progress, \\
Speed of strifeful strive \& striding \\
Thru the tallgrass sashes, passes \\
Tearing, steering, ripping, stripping.

Seeds his medley mettletested, restless, prescient; \\
Spat a stateley epithet \& spake soas to \\
Sate the breast, \& sans all rest, so \\
Dear to ear \& deathless, sleepless, \\
Tire when \& only pyre's fired, that his \\
Song the verdure quickened: Grass its grassing; \\
Grazer, grazing; sped \& fed the fiddlesickle, \\
Softly sighing.

Still it little mattered to some tattered \\
Scattered tones intoned against the stone unheard, \\
No living stirred \\
Nor stared, nor started at his Art-- \\
The starling prayed \& swift departed in \\
A parabolic arc.
