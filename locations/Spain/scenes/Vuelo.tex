Third-class tickets \\
To the interactive show \\
Of the Theatrical Security Administration.

Then, in cramp√®d quarters, was a witness \\
To the most-performed and longest running \\
Global modern dance show: \\
The stewardess, she signs the gestures' \\
Careful choreography; she \\
Indicates the exit rows, and exit flows, \\
In case of something wrongly goes, \\ 
But few attend to fishnet mime, but \\
Stare at screen or window, page or portal, \\
Presence in another world, ported \\
From marimba speedway, played on \\
Flashing jewelstrip airway.

Haven given upgrade seat to Mother, \\
So to sit with Childe, Slip up karmic thermals, \\ 
Dream of Sun-God-Glorious, sunbake on \\
Central Coast Savannah, \\
A kayaut and a grizzled oak in the highgrass revel, \\
Goodbye, America, Goodnight.

``Quit being mysterious and tell us your plans,'' \\
Wes'd prodded. I was fourwheeling, \\
Arcing from Spanish desert to Catholic Rome, \\
Pastureland \& peak. \\
``A river's that which knows the vale's lowest point,'' 
Anteros quoted. Who knows its highest point but man? \\
And whipping winds.

--Am I a Rockefeller's dream, \\
--Of some united future West? \\
--Or something else? \\
--Can I claim to dress myself?

When the steward comes she wakes me; \\
When the steward comes she asks me, "Sukar"? \\
And I answer "Si." \\
Knowingwhat we've said, \& what will come \\
But not the tongue we speak in.
