Then, in crampèd quarters, was a witness \\
To the most-performed and longest running \\
Global modern dance show: \\
The stewardess, she signs the gestures' \\
Careful choreography; she \\
Indicates the exit rows, and exit flows, \\
In case of something wrongly goes, \\
But few attend to fishnet mime, but \\
Stare at screen or window, page or portal, \\
Presence in another world, ported \\
From marimba speedway, played on \\
Flashing airstrip jewels,

Give up-grade window seat to Mother, \\
So to sit with Childe, \& karmic
Slip to dreams of Sungodglorious, \\
Central Coast Savannah, \\
With the kayaut and the grizzled oak, \\
The highgrass revel \\
God's home truly--Goodbye, America, \\
and Goodnight!

"Quit being mysterious and tell us your plans," \\
Wes says. A fourwheeled circumference \\
Of Etruria, the wreckèd Alps.
