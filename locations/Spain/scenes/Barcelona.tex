``The straight line belongs to men; \\
The curved line, to God.'' \\
\hfill --Gaudi

--Two Americans \\
--The Women who Love them, \\
--In a City that Despises them

Not so romantic as ``Quiéreme Siempre''; \\
Still, the centre has its charms-- \\
Gulls in the Art Nouveau city, \\
Temple of curves; hardrock porphyry.

Dawngress early to the hardbreakers: \\
La mar! La mére! \\
Past balcon undulation, \\
Meltwax columns, \\
Grid of iron: intricate \& curved.

Condensation's coral wake-- \\
Two contrails, forming cross behind the church, \\
And catch pink dawn, catch fire

Palm cloister a capela \\
Santa Catarina Market, \\
Built on catenated Monastery, \\
Keeping cloistered quadrille; \\
Old men carry fronds \\
I'm fond of them--I'd be the friend \\
Of any who might share their youth.

In Gracia, wisteria \\
Are all in bloom, as well as California-- \\
Early, tho, for flaca Magnols; \\
Just in time for squeeze of citrus \\
Under concrete scratching \\
``Foreigners, just kill yourselves.'' \\
In English, natch--``eunt domus.''\footnote{And go home they do--to the distress of the ministerium turismi.}

Sgraffiti on the walls at Vicens \\
Iron gate palmetto, where palmettos one day stood an \\
Ornament (``Que exotique!'') in gardens \\
Low an Arab smoking room, all \\
Built on boom years' short-lived edge, \\
A blight not yet arrived in Cataloñan vines \\
The decade fore the border-cross \\
Before the phylloxera's frost.
