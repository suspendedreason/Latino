``The straight line belongs to men; \\
The curved line, to God.'' \\
\hfill --Gaudi

--Two Americans \\
--The Women who Love them, \\
--In a City that Despises them

Not so romantic as ``Quiéreme Siempre''; \\
Still, the centre has its charms-- \\
Gulls in the  Nouveau city, \\
City of curves \& hardrock porphyry.

Dawngress to hardbreakers: \\
La mére! La mer! \\
Past undulated balcon, \\
Waxmelt columns \\
Irongrid so intricate \& curved.

Condensation's coral wake-- \\
Two contrails, forming cross behind the church, \\
And catch pink dawn, catch fire

Palm cloister a capela \\
Santa Catarina Market, \\
Built on Monastery, \\
Keeping cloistered quadrille.

And in Gracia, the wisteria \\
Are also in bloom-- \\
Too early, tho, \\
For these flaca Magnols \\
Just in time for squeeze of citrus \\
Under concrete scratching \\
``Foreigners, just kill yourselves.'' \\
In English, natch--``eunt domus.'' \\
(And go home they do, much to the stress of ministerium turismi.)

Sgraffiti on the walls at Vicens \\
Iron gate palmetto, where palmettos one day stood \\
Ornament (Que exotique!) in gardens \\
Low an Arab smoking room, all \\
Built on boom years' short-lived edge, \\
A blight, not yet arrived, in Cataloñan vines \\
Ten years, ten years \\
Between the war \\
Before the phylloxera.
