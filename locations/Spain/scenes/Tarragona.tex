...Tarragona's tower tolls the hour... 

Much like Barcelona, once \\
Bipolarized, to fort \& port, \\
To introspect \& interface. \\
First in steady stepping gress \\
To speciality.

Like a barbell: public, private \\
Like a bridge between two islands; \\
Like a foce and its gut; \\
With gullet-road to link them. 

This neverending ludos, \\
Self-distinction seeking \\
Econicheconstruction: \\
Guard a goal with equal spacing, \\
Campo's zone o'coverage.

Or how a flower's yellow petals \\
Radiate from center, \\
Seeking yet-uncaptured sun, while \\
Tethered in Augustan walls. The \\
Bloodred poppy, rooted pared-- \\

\qquad ...Oo-Oooooo-Oooo \\

--Young green in old stone while a \\
Mourning's ``Dove?'' coos in triple-time, \\
Playing hard to get, near cochineal, \\
Mong the cactus fruits of feline \\
Colony,

Past limestone--Miocene-- \\
The bossaged ashlar rows \\
And quoins, and azure waves.

Descent mimetic on misrecognition, \\
From the golden olden gules, we strolled-- \\
She talked of liquifying: \\
Talked of flowing finance, freezing over, \\
Talked expansion and contraction; \\
I was always looking down, wary of dogshit; \\
I was tired of looking down, and weary of my wariness--

Drank sangre to revitalize, in wooden chairs. \\
Everywhere the talk of stock all falling \\
Everywhere the morning doves in mourning \\
No more children anyway, the talk of \\
Every birthrate falling.

I must've been sundrunk \& sleepdeprived, \\
To buy that goddamn hat, \\
Trudging back from ruins. 

Soft light on the Reus creamstone, \\
Smell of oranges-- \\
Cleaning fluid? \\
Gentle heel-tap on marble alley echo \\
Pinnate leaflets in a breezefall \\
Wheeled windy out to sea which separates \\
And bridges all.

Self-mastery is master's master; \\
Alabaster stone in sea of gatorade; \\
Alabaster stone in silver foil, plated \\
Middle-earth, the public square of \\
Ancients' world.
