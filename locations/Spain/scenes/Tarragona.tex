Dwaughnggghh. Dwaughngggghhh. Dawauughngghhhh. \\
...Tarraco's tower tells the hour... 

Much like Barcelona, once \\
Bipolarized, to port \& fort, \\
To interface \& introspect-- \\
First in steady stepping gress \\
To speciality.

Like a barbell: public, private \\
Like a bridge between two islands; \\
Like a foce\footnote{/\textipa{"fo.\texttoptiebar{tS}e}/} and its gut; \\
With gullet-road to link them. 

This neverending ludos, \\
Self-distinction seeking \\
Econicheconstruction: \\
Guard a goal with equal spacing, \\
Campo's zone o'coverage.

Or how a flower's yellow petals \\
Radiate a center, \\
Seeking yet-uncaptured sun, while \\
Tethered in Augustan walls. The \\
Bloodred poppy, rooted pared, \\
Young green in old stone while

\qquad --...Oo-Oooooo-Oooo--

Morning's ``Dove?'' coos in triple-time, \\
Playing hard to get, near cochineal, \\
Mong the cactus fruits of feline colony.

Past limestone--Miocene-- \\
The bossaged ashlar rows \\
And quoins, and azure waves.

Descent mimetic on misrecognition, \\
Like the bulls of Turin: honored time-tradition \\
From the golden olden gules, we strolled-- \\
She talked of liquifying: \\
Talked of flowing finance, freezing over, \\
Talked expansion and contraction. \\
I was always looking down, wary of dogshit; \\
I was tired of looking down, and weary of my wariness--

Drank sangre to revitalize, in wooden chairs, \\
Feeling, on this day of days, like Eve by Swinton.\footnote{Jarmusch.} \\
Everywhere the talk of stock all falling \\
Everywhere the doves in mourning \\
No more children anyway, the talk of \\
Every birthrate falling. 

--I must've been sundrunk \& sleepdeprived, \\
--To buy that goddamn hat, trudging back from ruins. 

Soft light on the Reus creamstone, \\
Smell of oranges-- \\
Cleaning fluid? \\
Gentle heel-tap on marble alley echo \\
Pinnate leaflets in a breezefall \\
Wheeled windy out to sea which separates \\
And bridges all.

The Middle Earth: \\
Self-mastery is master's master; \\
Alabaster stone in sea of gatorade, \\
In silver foil, plated Middle-earth, \\
The public square of Ancientswhorld.
