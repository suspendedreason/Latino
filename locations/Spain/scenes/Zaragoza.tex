Zaragoza! Where the streetlamps wear crowns! \\
Zaragoza! Where sand runs red, and binders bind with calfskin. 

Plenas pulsas planetary; we \\
A pair o' peregrines much aspirant \\
To transcendent pairing, \\
Rising up with alas á la Lavoisier, \\
Or Curies--They had chemistry! \\

And me a Takhemoninomad, \\
\quad Fast-talkin monad, 'static in a shorter \\
\qquad Term alignment, \\
Bāb of his wisdom, \\
\quad The Spanish Miracle, \\
\qquad Convivial product of convivencia under \\
Blue-eyed Umayyad. \\
(Not like reconquistas crossing borders, birthing Catalan)

Caesaraugusta, the Romans called it-- \\
Saraqusta, spake the Moors, hence \\
The name al-Saraqusti, student second-order \\
Of the master al-Hariri.
