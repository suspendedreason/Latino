I wanted an accounting \\
Of how strong ships wreck \\
On subtlehidden stones. 

I wanted an accounting \\
Of how many great composers \\
Never found a venue, \\
Never found a patron, \\
Never found his players.

I was done with watercooler writing-- \\
Seedy news-- \\
The sidelines broadcast was OK, but \\
Shouldn't I be choosy with the games I chose to cover?

Anyway, \\
The best were all tacticians \\
Little soap, \& not a lot of sugar. \\
Their surface as implacable, \\
Uncrackable \& placid as brûleé.

He said, Look, \\
If you're not always trying \& failing \\
To pay attention to near \\
Everything in life then \\
What are you doing?

She said, \\
Too many big brave faces, \\
Scared of what might peek through pinhole \\
If they close their eyes.

The spirits argued with each other, \\
Shamed and cheered me from my shoulders; \\
Civic dust had set. \\
Me, 'n Newton, 'n conchas.

A sky full of ghosts, \\
Lights still traveling after the body was gone. \\
Or at least the body's form, \\
Since substance equals pattern.\footnote{``The holiness of saints survives the body [such that] it is an effective power for healing and blessing even after death...'' (Deborah Kapchan, ``Henna and Tatoo,'' adapted.}
