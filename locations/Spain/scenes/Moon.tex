As Red Pine, staring out at sunset \\
Ponders Sixteen Sutras, \\
So I think, in lunar gaze, of Prynne-- \\
His quiet night all bound in rising-falling; \\
Grasping, letting go; fidgeting \& flowing.

``The continuing patience \\
dilating into forms so \\
much more than compact.'' \\

So much more than compact, \\
Whispers Aeryn Sun; \\
A memory (it brings me back)-- \\
I nearly had a self once. \\
Til I grew bored with branding's borders; \\
Only saw its lack.

``The quiet
suggests that the act taken
extends so much further, there
is this insurgence of form:
we are more pliant than the mercantile notion 
of choice will determine''

So now I'm learning: \\
Of fluorescence--versus incandescence \\
Lit up, glowing; take the picture \\
Fore the waves disperse, senescent. \\
So I'm draining cup \& doubting; \\
Judging each my muscle movements \\
As if founding life-long habit.

Pah! It's but an hour later-- \\
Ere I have forgot it.
