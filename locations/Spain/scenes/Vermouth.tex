I fall. (How do you fall?) I remember. \\
I fly  (How do you fly? I remember.\footnote{Chris Knox}

Vermut: \\
A drowned \& winged thing had slipped inside my drink; \\
I lifted limp its body, which had sat all soggy \\
Several minutes still \& never stirring, \\
Til it resurrected woke, \\
\& spread its wings \\
\& sunward rose.

Ver'gutt, her glutes, in rise \& fall, but stop! \\
All these degrading games \\
It brings me down \\
Encases me in flesh.

A piston's pulse and rest is rhythm  \\
Breath and kick and rise again, \\
As muscles clenched, relax, \\
And who are we, to claim exemption?
