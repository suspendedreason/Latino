% ExqSci status: Rising

I fall. (How do you fall?) I remember. \\
I fly  (How do you fly?) I remember.\footnote{Chris Knox}

Vermut: \\
A drowned \& winged thing had slipped inside my drink; \\
I lifted limp its body, which had sat all soggy \\
Several minutes still \& never stirring, \\
Til it resurrected woke, \\
\& spread its wings \\
\& sunward rose.

Ver'gutt, her glutes, in rise \& fall, but stop! \\
All these degrading games \\
Encasing me in flesh.

Tempt: To try, to test, to stretch \\
An arm, in feeling out for form. \\
Contempt: A way to ward temptation \\
Off, to hold beneath your station \\
Or invoke a norm, to punish deviation \\
That one's envious of.

A piston's pulse and rest is rhythm  \\
Breath and kick and rise again, \\
As muscles clenched, relax, \\
And who are we, to claim exemption?
