% This is a good closing salvo section and perhaps shouldn't be wasted here
I Too Have Longed For Foreign Fields \\
Where nonecan read my soulprintheel. 

Or lazy daze'o'days on summer lawns all summer long, \\
and sans ambition.

--One need not always stand ready-- \\
--Able to explain oneself-- \\
--Tho one may want to--

Take this from one who desperate wants to be a goodman \\
That it's in my interest to become oneâ€” \\
or to Seem one, to Myself, eternal question, set it aside; \\
Still the search to mitigate \\
A second order  

--One need not always plague oneself with premonitions-- \\
--Save the energy expended, visioned future-- \\
--Flames on goal \& chalice-glow

Live without regret and guilt \\
And try to follow lark and not to flee from \\
Love and leave by golden carrot, \\
Not to learn by errors but \\
To double-down on deeds then.

--One need not seek for fountain flowing filling by itself in endless motion-- \\
--It will never be enough-- \\
--It will never last forever.
