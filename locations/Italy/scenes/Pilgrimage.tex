Italy for a walkabout.  \\
Tourism was the new pilgrimage. \\
It was a practice of contemplation and prayer. \\
You could draw the mountaineering throughline from the Romantics. \\
These days, climbers were less interested in the theoretical victory of the summit.

So much stayed the same while changing names. \\
He wanted to know the difference between hermit \& homeless; \\
Escape and exile, she answered.

We were in search of a heavenly home, \\
Somewhere under God's rays \\
Enough rain but not too much \\
We wanted to do something simple, \\
Land to ramble \\
Space to sing unheard except by bird, \\
To live in stone \& sun \& vegetal;-- \& \\
Leisure work \& play all one, \\
Or least their alternation.

--Is easily accomplished with Temporality.

(A lesson from the prairie's poets) \\
Takeaway sammies; turkey for eaters of flesh. \\
Travel as timetravel, a trip to the country. \\
Ask em to perform the old ways, throw em a buck. \\
Wash our feet in cool stream.

In Napoli \\
We gazed upon the sea \\
Its isles of time \\
Its oceans of perspective, \\
And the cliffs sang hymn to the setting sun.

Was there incident inciting? \\
The distant cry of gulls, on Western shore, or \\
Eve's forbidden fruit. A point at which you cannot go on being a part of it all, \\
Society I mean.
