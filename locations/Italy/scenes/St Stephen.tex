We brought him cheese, \& \\
Pink-lady apples; \\
He traded purple garden artichokes \\
For red transulence gooseberries, \\
And spoke on the beauty of van Morrison, \\
Donne, and Dylan's Backpages. \\
We brought the dog treats; \\
And I learned the meaning of hospitality, \\
The olive sprites bowed in breezy grace. \\
But he'd never heard ``Summertime in England'', \\
And found Malick hopeless slow.

He led a meditation with Sanskrit cant; \\
Learned from his Father before him, \\
Who'd learned it from India, \\
An Eastern infusion, for a church in much need of it.

I asked him how he chose the block to carve, \\
And each of a million chisels, \\
And the shape they summed to. 

And I asked the tower how it chose a hill to tower from. \\
And I asked the valley plot of land its plan and if it liked its veil.

And I asked the vine the trellis, \\
How it pathed up red, How short its sight, \\
How great its power where it long had learned to flourish, \\
In the search for light--

Except, sometimes, in stranger soils, \\
And quick-shift environs. \\
Then it climbs toward rays which will not feed it; \\
Then it feels, seeking, for what \\
Form it will not find there.
