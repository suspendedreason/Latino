Clouds cling on to Capri, \\
Just as fabrics on a thieving thorn. \\
Cinema's cuisine: To \\
Comer com os olhos; switch of skirts \\
It pulls our bonds apart, the boundless \\
Seaside girls-- \\
If smart is winning, \\
Wisdom's choosing games \\
The field of play, or else \\
(Pablo Falc√≥n) be King of Trash \\

Broombuds to the cliff-face cling \\
Enchanting clerestory bees. \\
The hotel (Lorelai its name) \\
For all its modern glass, for \\
All its blackquared steel, still exposed \\
The brick of past foundation in strategic stations: \\
Lowlylit, like light of candles; \\
Less for pleasure of the eye than \\
Guests's imagination.

Here along Sorrento's coast \\
Elites are being socialized-- \\
They socialize each other-- \\
Over drinks and photogenic views; \\
With men who made money in online casinos; \\
With gulls that lurk \& steal chips \\
While workers of the world work \\
To system dreams of tiny teams \\
From coasts of California. \\
(Steve's garage around her mother's corner.) \\
And even Spanish mother-daughter \\
Speak in angled tongue to order, \\
Using words of protest from \\
A people known for having points.\footnote{\& Anteros, risking Pointless Forest.}
