Clouds cling on to Capri like fabrics on a thieving thorn. \\
Cinema's cuisine: Comer com olhos; skirtswish \\
(It pulls our bonds apart, the boundless) \\
Seaside girls-- \\
If sharps are winning wisdom's choosing games \\
A field of play: Pablo FalcÃ³n King of Trash.

Broombuds to the cliff-face cling \\
Enchanting clerestory bees. \\
% And shaded brooms are late to bloom. \\
The hotel (Lorelai its name) \\
For all its modern glass, for \\
All its blacksquared steel still exposed \\
The brick of past foundations framed in careful-chosen stations: \\
Lowlylit like candlelight; \\
Less for pleasure of the eye than \\
Guests's imagination.

Here along Sorrento's coast \\
Elites are being socialized-- \\
They socialize each other-- \\
Over drinks and photogenic views; \\
With men who made money in online casinos; \\
With gulls that lurk \& steal chips \\
While workers of the world work \\
To system dreams of tiny teams \\
From coasts of California. \\
--Steve's garage around her mother's corner.-- \\
And even Spanish mother-daughter \\
Speak in angled tongue to order, \\
Using words of protest from \\
A people known for having points.\footnote{\& Anteros, risking Pointless Forest.}
