No Simple Trick Nor Secret, Childe-- \\
Just to notice, not to shy from \\
Truth, intentional attention

Tactics you can bórrow, \\
Suuuuure. \\
Méchanísms tó adápt súre but--

But what? \\
Each problem different; \\
Different goals \& gods \& sense of good \& \\
Different setting, \\
All the background we're forgetting

Every act unique transform \\
From global state to state \\
To state in méchanique form \\
Not just billiards sure \\
But what else is change, if not \\
The yawning mouth of rivers?

So many words \& phrases coined \\
In efforts to control the waters, \\
Intellect and OODA, passionate expression

Which in simplest term was life, adapting, reconfigured \\
Form to meet \& match the form that formed informèd sees.
