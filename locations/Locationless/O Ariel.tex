O Ariel! \\
How have you become so heavy? \\ 
Bound in arborescence \\
By maternal witch. \\
When will you surge aerial, \\
And sing a higher pitch? 

O Ariel: \\
Now though you serve a better master, \\
Still your heart beats faster \\
At a word like ``free''.

O Ariel! \\
A rebel angel, \& a cynic \\
Overcome by Abdiel, \\
The zeal of religious zealots.

So much I would say, would I saw Ariel. \\
Walking peat, Fennario. % NB: Fen + ario, walking peat = Macbeth

O Ariel-- \\
Thou hast been a Camel, once; \\
Now thou art become a Lion; \\
When the gyre turneth around, \\
Thou shalt be as Childe.
