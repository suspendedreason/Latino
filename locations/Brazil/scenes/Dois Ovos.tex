My mustache died a perma-purple, sipping those elixirs. \\
Such good times, I'd stumble downstairs past the doorguard \\
Find a table on the sidewalk, wait to say \\
The same words every time, a joy just getting right: \\
--Bonjia, todovem. Dois ovos, sim, meshidos-— \\
--E cafe com leite—e um suco com laranja, por favor--

And most times getting what I'd wanted, hoped and tried for. \\
Well, I won't trouble you with a theory of language \\
But it felt like singing, and it felt like magic.
