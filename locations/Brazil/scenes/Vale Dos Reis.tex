Yesca in the hammock: \\
Cricketquiet, \\
Beetlebreeze \& birdcall \\
Smalltown silence, \\
Ruffled branches' windfall \\
Whispered dogfight \\
Butterflies like biplanes \\
Particles' positions showing \\
Hidden currents \\
Like the hawk atop a thermal.

And all the birds in bin'ry rhythm \\
Perch, suspend, \& perch again \\
Perch \& fly \& \\
Rest \& risk \& rest again \\
Glide, exert \& glide \\
Til distant thunder scatters.

Buffeted by current flows \\
\& ebbs recurring subtly like \\
Fortune's fastest layer fashioned \\
from what shoreward ocean washes.

In the morning, up early, \\
walk \& autosong \& \\
paracosmic play that's interrupted by a \\
century of beetles, still on glassy pool, \\
nearby below electric bulbs, \\
and flat against the windshield.

Cris kicks his legs in chlorine, \\
Tells me how a Language is a set of Patterns, \\
And the Patterns are the building-blocks \\
Of all the story Traces that we tell.
