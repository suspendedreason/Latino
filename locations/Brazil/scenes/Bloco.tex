Mobile storehouse, \\
Hip-secured from \\
Sticky fingers, artful dodger \\
Bur or barb or claw or bristle.

Plunge into a sweating sea: \\
Sunbrellas, togas, boas, leis, and \\
Tridents, fishnets, highwaist jorts, and \\
Devil horns, and angel wings at blocos. 

“Are you single?” “Yes” \\
is pure permission \\
when a subject's tacit. \\
Gabe is here, he says, \\
to drink \& piss \& french \\
in any order; You say: \\
if a shark stops swimming— 

Small tiff among sardines near \\
Startles up stampede, with \\
Defense read as offense \\
In an escalation cycle. 

All the boys are talking tactics \\
“Should I play the gringo?” \\
Foakleys, funk, \& Rita Leena \\
Asking for a tongueless kiss \\
Then going in for bite. 

Rest now, under stonefruit tree \\
Notice bottom branches bare. \\

Some of us still shy with Western sickness speech \\
Glissandos fallen wrong side of the Yerkes \& Dodson, think \\
“Obliterate this sudden fucking fear, this inwardness," while \\
Chanting stomping rain dance round the \\
Water truck as burly men lift \\
Longgthicc waterhose \& spray a \\
Begging sweating bareskinned crowd so \\
Loud \& rowdy; later on, at lunch \\
(For this was still the morning) \\
I transform to Jesus by infusion: smoke \& \\
Awning shade \& suca, vitaminas e azucar.
