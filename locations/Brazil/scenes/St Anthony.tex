Scavenge, deconstruction zone \\
On red pared that leads uphill \\
Unto the Church of Anthony, \\
Of thousand feathergold rocailles \\
Plant-dyed red rocococo. \\

On laudinum, my thoughts turned in- \\
\qquad choate and porous, reading old inscription \\
``Laud him thus in chord \& chorus, organ, corpus'' \\
Golden awe by self-description.

Walls all packed with whale, grass \\
And cowshit, hardened mud, the \\
Greeks, Chinese, \& Arabs carved, so \\
Slanted eyes on half the cherubs \\
Hybrids of imp√©rio era. \\

And ninety days by mule for music, \\
Putrefactive oozing up from \\
Floorboards for the patron's pleasure \\
Incense lit in steamy weather \\
Brides brought in bouquets to stifle \\
Smell of death with life, or something close: \\
The cellulose of life-stem snipped \\
And stripped of lignin, pressed \\
In sheets to take impress, collect \\
In this anthologize \& wrecking prize: \\
Ninety days by mule.
