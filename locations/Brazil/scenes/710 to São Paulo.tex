% Our protagonist flies to Brazil. At the airport, he catches a coffee and a cab.

% ExqSci status: WRECKED & DESCENDING

7:10 São Paulo-- \\
Centered cell of numbered seats, \\
A sleepless press of bodies \\
Strain against constraint, containers.
% The regular S- alliteration here is snakeish, Satanic.

By descent a mindwreck, \\
Neck-kinked, bleary, drifting \\
Tack \& list toward slipspace sorted rows; then \\
Watch an ad to hop on public network, \\
(Sell a stare for signal) \\
Call a cab \& grab a coffee, \\
(Summon carriage, Javanese revival) \\
Global Starbuck station; \\
Shape my mouth in novel ways to \\
Make the sounds which soon will come so \\
Easily:

--Bonjia, um cafe com leite-- \\
--Créjito; sim, por favor--

A simple favor, would you? Paltry \\
Pretense, game politeness, pass my plastic-- \\
Skip the tip in strange, familiar waters-- \\
Same old roles in same old Latin.
% NB: Half-rhymes of paltry/waters, plastic/Latin here
