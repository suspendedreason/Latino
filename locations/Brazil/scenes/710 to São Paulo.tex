7:10 São Paulo-- \\
Center sandwiched, \\
Neck-kinked, bleary, custom files; \\
Watch an ad to hop on public network, \\
Call a cab \& grab a coffee \\
Global Starbuck station; \\
Shape my mouth in novel ways to \\
Make the sounds which soon will come so easy: \\
--Um cafe com leite--por favor--e créjito \\
A simple favor, would you? Minor pretense, game \\
Politeness, pass my plastic-- \\
Skip the tip in strange familiar waters-- \\
Same old roles in same old Latin.
