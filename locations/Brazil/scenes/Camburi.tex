--As the laundry women'd say-- \\
--Amante especial, oi vei-- 

At the service counters, clients \\
Tracking comedramas of their catenary \\
Clientele (For if one must thus pay attendance, \\ 
Ought enjoy the bought performance.)\footnote{And if one plans to buy a pair of pants, one \\
Ought as well to get them tight, so anyone'll bed you. --O'Hara, ``Personism''}

And then to Camburi on the coast-- \\
A virgin when it came to açai, you know \\
My first time really getting it, \\
And the golden stray who limped, before we \\
Lept from solid rocks to flowing pool below and \\
Used the roots like ropeswing.

Of course we all thought of Tarzan, \\
We'd all seen the movie, hadn't we? \\
And the mere mention of tucans lent a scent, \\
A flavor to the scene.

Ô Mãe d'Água-- \\
Early morning rising singing \\
Walking sandy sickle shore along the veiny sea and \\
Feeling young, eternal perched on \\ 
Billion-year-old boulders, under ancient skies \& all the \\
Tidelines marked by barnacle, \& \\
Not me crying, ``Not this time!'' \\
To loneliness, who many times before had tried \\
To wash upon these rocks of mine.
