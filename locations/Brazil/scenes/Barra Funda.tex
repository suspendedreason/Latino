Up all night at plastic tables, \\
Round red table, talking, overcompf \&
Sating, Harmony in poetry, I said \& \\
Showed a spectograph, or gram \\
And played the sound of prairie dogs, \\
Who yip a sentence in an instance \\
Vertisplayed as chord.

Or down in Barra Funda, \\
Kicking back, \& clinking glasses with the \\
Little cups, that make litr√£os seem so abundant. \\
Watch the wild \\
Life while milling \\
Toby reads the room like David  \\
Attenborough, Austen, Doyle \\
Footwear, fannypack in style. 

/Sing/ \\
--All the girls in little black dresses \\
--Touch their lips and twiddle their tresses. 

Cars pull up unloading friends \\
And leaving, loading up on lovers; \\
Others couple on the concrete, \\
Some third wheel spins feigned absence, \\
Acting out an endless cycle: \\
Hot-girl summer; cuffing season.

Afterwards, well. I go home, and smoke on the street. Give my butt to a beggar, and walk the hood for hours.

And I find Frank's ``Personism''--surfing, back in bed, to fill the empty pre-dawn.

And because all these foreign placenames make me think of Frank, like "Lady Died," \\
I say: I'll write a poem addressed to Ari and my boyhood self: \\
A sign of my love for the both of ya.
