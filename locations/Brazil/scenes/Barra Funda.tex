% His first night, the protagonist drinks in a young trendy neighborhood
% and people watches while chatting and sharing litrãon of beer with his
% Brazilian friend.

% The poet goes home and wanders the streets. 
% He encounters some of the desperation and madness of a city of sin.
% He retreats to his laptop and reads Frank O'Hara's Personism manifesto.

Up all night that night at \\
Plastic tables, round red tables \\
Kicking back \& clinking glasses with the \\
Little cups, that make litrãos seem so abundant.

Down at Barra Funda, \\
Watching wildlife the milling \\
Rites while Toby reads the room, like David  \\
Attenborough, Austen, Doyle \\
Footwear, fannypack, the styled assets.

You get a sense at once, he says-- \\
The head-to-toe assembly. \\
Harmony in poetry, I said \& show a spectogram.

And play the sound of prairie dogs, \\
Who yip a sentence in an instant \\
Vertisplayed as chord.

--All the girls in little black dresses\footnote{Sung} \\
--Touch their lips and twiddle their tresses. 

% The rites had little hold on married men, \\
% Forbidden pleasures... Íncompatible pleasures... \\
% Which imagination burnished, \\
% Eliding all the effort burnt, \\
% In tactics and confusion.

Cars pull up unloading friends \\
And leaving, loading up on lovers; \\
Others couple on the concrete, \\
Some third wheel spins feigned absence, \\
Acting out an ancient cycle: \\
Hot-girl summer; cuffing season.

Afterwards, well. I go home, and smoke on the street and give my butt to a beggar. I drink a yoghurt, and watch a guy go crazy, just screaming drunk in another man's face. Spot someone squat, and shit on the pavement and kick it, like a dog. I've been going round, photographing the inside of trash cans; I've been interested in a neighborhood's waste, in its disposal systems, in its use of clear \& colored bags.

% Past the pichação, cryptic aerosol alphabet, and the spraycan murals,
% Pieces / getting up / heaven

And I find O'Hara's ``Personism''--surfing, back in bed, to fill the empty pre-dawn. Still nocturnal, the long burnout from workathon, but looking for voices; still not liking the sound of my voice; still mimicking the music of others, trying to blend my own.

And cause all these foreign placenames make me think of Frank, \\
Who wrote his lines like letters, \\
I'll make to write to Ariel \\
My brother and my boyhood self.
