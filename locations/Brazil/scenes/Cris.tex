And then dropped at the airport \\
Poor Anteros-- \\
Actually, she took a car-- \\
We were deciding where to live, \\
And how. A course of trips, to tell; \\
We wanted: Lat'nate language; \\
Warmish weather; land to steward; \\
Stock to manage.

After she was gone I rearranged the dining room. \\
Turned the TV on Megachurch \& Christian infomercial. \\
And I went to work for many hours, \\
\& neither ate nor left until the sun \\
Went down  the third of days.

Then so giddy, kicking, skipping on the sidewalk, \\
Like San Cristobal, singing \\
\qquad Mama, Mama, Mama \\
\qquad Don't take my kodachrome away.

Cris? He was learning to read the city, \\
He was taking the same walk, everyday, \\
Just seeing what happened-- \\
How it worked \& how the parts fit, \\
What it meant ``at the end of the day''. \\
He was writing about Parisian corn carts; \\
The conversion of mass-produced goods \\
Into custom forms, over years and generations, \\
So to suit the sellers' needs. \\
His fascination was in nomads \& textiles, \\
In minimum-viable rigs, \& packing light. \\
He always noticed people's shoes; \\
I told him the bit about Frost, abroad. \\
One exlover in Janeiro said, \\
\qquad ``That's the thing about Cris
\qquad He's always ever looking.''
She said he was a gringo, for \\
Describing polvinho as tapioca dust. \\
She said he was a gringo, for \\
The way he wore his fannypack, \\
To discourage thieves.
