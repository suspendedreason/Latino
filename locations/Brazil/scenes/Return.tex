Cuntry to Seedy, \\
A classic migration, \\
Cycling makes analepsis proleptic amidst \\
Idylling cars and the echoing birdcalls, \\
A kind of uniformitarianism,\\
Prophet's perfect tense not far from carv√®d stone-time:
--Wenn du mich siehst, dann weine-- \\
Which it was to Kerouac, in ``Big Sur'', \\
A fall, like killing Cain, who founded cities, \\
That book is a book about projecting your perception onto a landscape, \\
Like thinking the Heavens were a great dome overhead, \\
And then learning of yourself, through the glints of light that bounce back.

--But how do you choose your form?-- \\
--How do you choose your name? How do you choose your life?-- \\
--How do you choose the time you must exhale-- \\
--And kick, and rise?--

In the same way us \& all the yunguns \\
Tempted by the views of light that shine through screens \\
Of distant wildlife, missed encounters, curtained parties \\
Work our way in labyrintime and towards it, \\
Missing great white light that shines through keyhole polymorphous \\
No final form, said Knausgaard-- \\
And what, then, might I risk becoming?

Triune darkness at the edge of town. \\
Distant Bladerunner ziggurat, \\
Back to the C\textsc{ity} of metamours and kipple \\
\qquad Yoyodyne \& Mordor \\
Where they eat numbers \\
Where shiny people dance to shiny music \\
And gather in the Afters \\
Of the snake 'n ladders of careers. \\

And me--voidward, narrowcast \& murd'rous \\
Megaphone midst failson \& faildaughter, \\
Slow beset by paterdreaming pitter-patter.
