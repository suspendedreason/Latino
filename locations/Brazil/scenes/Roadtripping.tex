Says Crístobál, this region's known for \\
climbing, then corrects my accent: \\
``Meu nome é Cristóbal`` \\
I say, Fair enough but good luck iambs, \\
Other rhythms here resisting meter; \\
When I ask for handholds \\
What I get are handles: \\
Crimps \& jugs \& pockets \& rails, \\
In-cuts, slopers; slippy, chaussy, glassy-- \\
Then he gives one of his famous \\
reports from the interior; \\
``Check the raincoat'' he says, \\

Recall-- \\
(Proleptic analepsis) bite o' \\
Meatbeer breakfast, bar o' \\
Mushroom chocolate \\
Parque Nausea, under árbol, \\
Dozenmile walk, \\
Fine rums by Thames \\
(All overproof) \& \\
Sideline goofing.

Recall-- \\
A screaming Carioc \\
Til dawn-- \\
The rain, the fortune's sons \\
The blueridged mountains, rolling \\
Rivers, smokehoarse \\
(Jim had mimicked Satchmo) \\
Then, hungover, hair of \\
Most exquisite science, \\
Heronbeast, hysteric, naked, \\
Raving nightsweat, conislide, sex dream-- \\
``Brotha!''

\& it's Me, the Mockingbird \\
Up at dawn with morning dove \\
To learn the songs of valleys, \\
Sing an alba for my love.
