Heaven's hammock lulled us \\
Singing long to Dylan \\
Merica's new folk song canon: \\
``Graceland,'' ``Country Roads'' \& Newman

Bobby with his breathless beat-rap
\footnote{Swinton's Roland--Knausgaard nods--`No final form enclosed him.'} \\
Cosmic Cassady, ecstatic \\
Dana Ward and Manley Hopkins \\
(``Leaden Echo,'' read by Burton)

``One who sings with tongue on fire'': \\
Lit by Guthrie, lit up Davy;  \\
Lizardking is flying, crying \\
``Girl, we couldn't get much higher.'' \\
So a network relays power.

As kingfisher bares its breast, \\
And embers wake by oxidation, \\
Musement warms a mailed loin, and \\
Collins, dissertating terms,\footnote{Randall, \textit{Sociology of Philosophies}.} \\
Built networks in'ergetic transfer: \\
Motion motivates emotion.

--Mitchell splices plus \& minus;\footnote{Joni, ``Electricity''.} \\

% What's the point of this?
(Frankenstein the caf√© site of \\
Beatnik luau--bamboo hat, a Byron goat'e \\
Leading sixteen-something babes in \\
Martial forms of meditation: \\
Fifties haunt Laguna Beach
In geometric visitation.)

And what profits prophet? \\
Fasting, foreign soils; \\
Substance, contemplation? \\
Fasting, isolation, altered states \& novel inputs; \\
Excess to perturb the system; \\
(Cycle-slain not far from Bixby)

...Avid phrasing... measured breath, a \\
Trumpet... magic scribbles... blowing on a subject; \\
Anaphoric rhythm, vital dash, and speechy pauses...

Sensitive fellers, indulgent of transient desires. \\
First thought right thought, \\
Cocky chestpuff, \\ % Meh
Messi instinct improv, \\ % Good
Camp'd Mars athletics.
