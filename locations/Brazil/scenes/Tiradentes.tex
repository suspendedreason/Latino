Tiradentes: Town of 7,000 seated at the base of the São José mountain range. Named for a Revolutionary dentist.

Sitting on a park bench when you texted. \\
Said: ``To feel the cool of rain \& heat of sun at once-- \\
That is a higher pleasure''

% This feels like a big toneshift from above
This lucky duck gets to see a \\
Sun dog on phanerothymes, gets to see an \\
Abbiocco in breeze-blocks, while Cris \\
Reads out on his Anki.

Perched among the stoneyflower, \\
Starseed, phototropes while \\
Roots reach down, commensurate \\
With upward motion-- \\
Sky-grasp by a strong foundation-- \\

And speaks of fabled Brásil lightness, \\
Burdened less by static contracts-- \\
In support he quotes Calvino; \\
Cards to read in native language.
