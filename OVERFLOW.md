Epicormic buds
Freeks
Labyrintime
Shadown to Sunprise of a Solrisa

For gain’o’grain they banner-band together

You creo, you creo, y hecho un hecho

And in Girona, the architect's concave torso, like the mouth of a lion: Upper jaw the bend of torso; lower jaw his table and plans. And his plans? The church nave's radial straights; his fists, clenched, are fangs; his head is bowed, a leonine roar of Vulgar Latin.

\qquad Hang it hang it hang it all \& \\
\qquad Pin it pending on the wall, yeah \\
\qquad Hang me til I'm dead and gone I'm \\
\qquad Pining for a pin-up world:

\qquad Not the stillness of the stall \\
\qquad Not the squawking of the squall \\
\qquad But a pinechest full of treasures all, \\
\qquad Been all around this world. \\

I was hurt. Complimenti, you bitch \\
He said, \& did away with my dark heart.
<!-- Reference to Eliot & Pound -->

Soda fountain static--pins'n'needles
Noisy mouthedfeel

Stucco wall like rain on water

Aztec ravers, PLURgirls, pulled myself away
<!-- This needs to happen somewhere new, but is important part--somethingabout decadence of cities -- maybe in Rio? -->

What doth it profit prophet,
To proffer his fits?

My face was growing out to curls;
It was a way to track time.
Shear everything above the neck
And then don't cut again til back

We were homies-in-law
We hung back, and let the girls talk
He studied colonies of the gut
They called him the Shark
Then Israel-Palestine \& I never saw him again

Here is the church, here is the steeple; here is the door \& here are the people \\

Hands like newly furled leaves of horse chestnut^[Hope Mirrlees]

Hunched & guarded hardened
hardly generous to world, given
fingersinger, a read on
gin craze, watching
concretecardboard needledreamers
urine-yellowed lawns

And is a self then, merely a center of gravity
In our social fictions?
Or a complex of subsystems, needing no supervision,
Like a colony of termites?
What is this Master Plan?
What need have I for a single declaration,
For the encompassing label?

The girls are Old Masters of brush & blush. Dark foundations through lightdusted overcoat. Now the perfume bottles. Whole carriage smell of bouquet. I felt myself traversing the curve of a Yerkes-Dodson while she spoke.

Tiling in the icy interiors,
In each room, the same furniture
Conditioned on social class \& feed

(In N Hemisphere) where a dogwood tree is losing its mind\footnote{T. Hoagland}

Polystyrene
Poly sirens
Ply their styles—
Renegotiate their terms
Of social presence.
