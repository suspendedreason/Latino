And in Girona, the architect's concave torso, like the mouth of a lion: Upper jaw the bend of torso; lower jaw his table and plans. And his plans? The church nave's radial straights; his fists, clenched, are fangs; his head is bowed, a leonine roar of Vulgar Latin.

\qquad Hang it hang it hang it all \& \\
\qquad Pin it pending on the wall, yeah \\
\qquad Hang me til I'm dead and gone I'm \\
\qquad Pining for a pin-up world:

\qquad Not the stillness of the stall \\
\qquad Not the squawking of the squall \\
\qquad But a pinechest full of treasures all, \\
\qquad Been all around this world. \\
