# Overflow

We were freeks.
We were labrats in labyrintime.
We were sufferers of zugunruhe.
We were epicormic buds--
Damage to the main trunk activated our waiting phototropism

Shadown to Sunprise of a Solrisa

For gain’o’grain they banner-band together

Silent scroll. Window service. Framed existence.

You creo, you creo, y hecho un hecho

And in Girona, the architect's concave torso, like the mouth of a lion: Upper jaw the bend of torso; lower jaw his table and plans. And his plans? The church nave's radial straights; his fists, clenched, are fangs; his head is bowed, a leonine roar of Vulgar Latin.

\qquad Hang it hang it hang it all \& \\
\qquad Pin it pending on the wall, yeah \\
\qquad Hang me til I'm dead and gone I'm \\
\qquad Pining for a pin-up world:

\qquad Not the stillness of the stall \\
\qquad Not the squawking of the squall \\
\qquad But a pinechest full of treasures all, \\
\qquad Been all around this world. \\

I was hurt. Complimenti, you bitch \\
He said, \& did away with my dark heart.
<!-- Reference to Eliot & Pound -->

Soda fountain static--pins'n'needles
Noisy mouthedfeel

Stucco wall like rain on water

Aztec ravers, PLURgirls, pulled myself away
<!-- This needs to happen somewhere new, but is important part--somethingabout decadence of cities -- maybe in Rio? -->

What doth it profit prophet,
Thus in proffering his fits?

Contemplative practice
Puts us in a position
To realize we do not occupy a position
Of privileged episteme.\footnote{R. Stevens}

My face was growing out to curls;
It was a way to track time.
Shear everything above the neck
And then don't cut again til back

We were homies-in-law
We hung back, and let the girls talk
He studied colonies of the gut
They called him the Shark
Then Israel-Palestine \& I never saw him again

Here is the church, here is the steeple; here is the door \& here are the people \\

Talent is not the factor.
Sight is not the factor.
So many drop out: The whip sharp.
She was smaht enagh for Hahvahd Yahd.
What was it, melted wax o' faith?
World gets em, \& by world mean I people?
Silent tongues inside her temples?

Hands like newly furled leaves of horse chestnut^[Hope Mirrlees]

Hunched & guarded hardened
hardly generous to world, given
fingersinger, a read on
gin craze, watching
concretecardboard needledreamers
urine-yellowed lawns

And is a self then, merely a center of gravity
In our social fictions?
Or a complex of subsystems, needing no supervision,
Like a colony of termites?
What is this Master Plan?
What need have I for a single declaration,
For the encompassing label?

Fly from air to airspace,
Cold kitchen tiles in icy interiors,
The same furniture.
Here a city center district
Historied in theory, storiated porticos
While windows glass the greatest fashions
Here is the same luxury watch, seen in Vicenza and Florence
Here is are the summer fits, the linen stripes, the knitted shirts
With a weight, and hand-made feel, that made them all the rage, a wealthy signal gainst the contours of a Chinese cotton tshirt
But which the factories have figured out how to fabricated en bulk
And now seen on all the young men
Of Western Europe.
