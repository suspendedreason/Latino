# Context & Aspirations

## Text

_LATINO: A PASTORAL_ is part of a larger collection of Brazil-related works, with which it might eventually be packaged as part of a printed collection:

- Brazil emails ("local media")
- The São Paulo notebook
- Photos taken by the author on his travels
- The "Diane" voice memos (transcripts of which may be available )
- Letter written to Anteros
- Biografía: Abrão

### Annotations

<!-- Hard-to-resolve comments (a finished version of?) are kept in body/gitrepo... Obvious calls are kept but for the tougher call a record of indeterminacy/contingency alternate paths is kept -->

## Audio

Many of _LATINO_'s semantic gestures are oral auditory (complex rhythms, voices, accents, phonetic specifications, foreign language borrowings, pop lyrics).

A recording of the entire poem would be ideal, since it would help instill the desired shifts of tone and tempo between sections.

Some recording notes:

- Song lyrics whenever practicable should be sung, following their original melody.
- Birdsong, recordings of discussed birds should be included in the background of the relevant sections, or sections where plausibly the narrator is out of doors.
- Church music (organ or choral) might be played when inside various churches, or even layered with birdsong.
- Diane sections (if included) should be read in an imitation of Dale Cooper, with relevant background noises (a train station; an automobile) layered behind.

As for voices,

- The "Childe" (i.e. "Where Are You?") sections have a distinct tone of voice.

## The Wasteland

_Latino_ is loosely structured to follow _The Wasteland_.

Eliot's friendlysplendid chat, 'ohmelovelies' etc, an aspiration of _Latino_.
